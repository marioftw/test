    "- Descriptive Statistics simply describe what is observed. The average height of a high school football team can be directly calculated by measuring all of the current players height.\n",
    "- When doing inferential statistics we are trying to say something general about a larger group of subjects than those we have measured. To continue the football example, we would be doing descriptive statistics if we wanted to know about the average height of all high school football teams.\n",
    "    - To put it another way, statistical inference is the process by which we take observations of a subset of a group and generalize to the whole group.\n",
    "    - In statistics the entire group is known as the population while the subset is a sample\n",
    "    - We would use samples if the population is:\n",
    "        - Too big to enumerate\n",
    "        - Difficult, time consuming or expensive to get new samples\n",
    "- Predictive statistics is when we don’t so much care about the relationships between variables but how accurate* the outputs are"
